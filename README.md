# PC builder toy

This is just a hacky toy to build a new PC. From a set of components several
builds can be derived. The costs per build are calculated and show along with
an overview. Alternativly a link list can be generated or opened.

Don't expect to much. Especially documentation. This is (klingon software)[https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/1675]. If it
bites you, it's entirely your fault ;)
