# PC builder tool

This is just a hacky tool to build a new PC. From a set of components several
builds can be derived. The costs per build are calculated and show along with
an overview. Alternativly a link list can be generated opened.

Don't expect to much. Especially documentation. This is klingon software. If it
bites you, it's entirely your fault ;)
